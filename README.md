# LinearLayoutApp
In this project we will create a simple layout using the following components.
```
1. LinearLayout = Root View
2. 4 TextViews.
3. 1 Button
```

Text views have different properties:
```
1. marginTop = used to give margin
2. layout_gravity = to assign layout depending upon the parent screen. i.e. left, center, right.
3. orientation = used to assign any orientation for LinearLayout specifically.
4. id:@+id/ = used to assign a new id to any component.
```
# Note:
```
* id can never be same for 2 or more components.
* When you open any component, make sure you close it's tag also.
* Always focus on one component at a time.
```
